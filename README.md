# Overview

This project is half of a system built to help manage events run by the [PAX Pok√©mon League](https://paxpokemonleague.net) both online and at in-person PAXes. It consists of an API built to support the [PPL Webapp](https://github.com/lunemily/ppl-in-person) frontend. It's set up to present its public-facing API through Express and be driven off of a MySQL database, the expected schema of which can be found in a comment near the top of the [core.js](db/core.js) database module. In order to set up a new instance, you need to:

1. Clone the project and install all the dependencies with npm.
2. Make a copy of the [config.js.example](config/config.js.example) file simply named config.js.
3. Populate the API configs appropriately for your environment:
    - The `debug` field indicates whether the node application should run in debug mode. Setting this to `true` will enable console input in the running application, as well as the `debugSave` function on the database module.
    - The `port` field is the port that the API will listen on, and should be an open port on the machine running this node application.
    - The `botApiPort` field is optional and only relevant for events that make use of the PPLBot project (link to come) for reporting updates to Discord.
    - The `certPath` field is a local filepath to your cert file so the API can be served over HTTPS. If you don't have a cert set up, check out LetsEncrypt to get started.
    - The `corsOrigin` field can be either a string or an array of strings, and each string should be a domain that's permitted to access the API.
    - The `mysql...` fields configure the database connection, and will vary depending on how your system is set up.
    - The `tableSuffix` field is optional and applies a suffix to all table names queried by the database module if specified. This is useful for setting up a staging environment with a separate set of tables from those used in production.
4. Populate the event configs appropriately for your PPL event:
    - The `...SurveyUrl` fields are links to surveys to be filled out by Hall of Fame entrants, challengers, and leaders respectively. The former is typically used for challengers to submit their winning teams, and the latter two are for general feedback.
    - The `surveyStartDate` and `surveyDurationDays` fields define when the survey links should be sent down in API responses and for how long. The start date is typically the final day of a PPL event.
    - The `trainerCardShowDate` field defines when the trainer card should start appearing in the webapp. It's typically the day of the champion reveal, so that leader names and art can be pre-loaded without challengers seeing them early.
    - The `bingoBoardWidth` field defines the dimensions of the board used for the leader bingo side activity. It should typically be less than the square root of the number of leaders and elites combined (e.g. a 4x4 or 5x5 board for a pool of 30 total non-champion leaders).
    - The `requiredBadges` and `requiredEmblems` fields define how many badges and emblems a challenger needs to face elites and the champion, respectively. If `requiredEmblems` is set to 0, `requiredBadges` will be used for the champion check as well as elites.
    - The `maxQueueSize` field defines how many challengers a leader can have in their queue at a given time. This should typically be large for in-person events and more restricted during online events.
    - The `maxQueuesPerChallenger` field defines how many leader queues a challenger can be in at once.
    - The `excludedBingoIds` field is an array of leader ID strings that defines what, if any, leaders should be excluded when constructing new bingo boards. This should be used in cases where multiple leaders have the same ace/Tera and you want to avoid collisions.
5. Run `node startup.js`. **Note**: This *may* require `sudo` to run, depending on the permissions on the cert path.

If everything is correctly configured, you should see a few log statements appear indicating that the API is running. You can validate it by using curl, a simple web browser (for the GET requests), or another tool of your choice.

- `message` - The message string to be logged.
- `stackTrace` - A stack trace to be logged with the message body. This param is optional.

##### Response payload:

```json
{}
```

##### Possible error responses:

- HTTP 400 (BAD REQUEST) - Returned if the request body doesn't contain a message param.
- HTTP 500 (SERVER ERROR) - Returned if a database error occurs.

## Constants

The [constants.js](util/constants.js) file contains the following constant definitions:

#### resultCode

These codes will be returned in **most** error payloads alongside an error string, to provide additional context around the nature of the error.

```json
{
    "success": 0,
    "dbFailure": 1,
    "notFound": 2,
    "alreadyInQueue": 3,
    "alreadyWon": 4,
    "queueIsFull": 5,
    "tooManyChallenges": 6,
    "notInQueue": 7,
    "usernameTaken": 8,
    "registrationFailure": 9,
    "badCredentials": 10,
    "invalidToken": 11,
    "queueIsClosed": 12,
    "notEnoughBadges": 13,
    "notEnoughEmblems": 14,
    "unsupportedDifficulty": 15,
    "unsupportedFormat": 16,
    "unsupportedPushPlatform": 17,
    "tokenAlreadyRegistered": 18,
    "tokenNotRegistered": 19,
    "queueAlreadyOpen": 20,
    "queueAlreadyClosed": 21,
    "duoModeNotSupported": 22
}
```

#### leaderType

These are used to identify what battle difficulties a leader supports, and will both be returned in some payloads and expected as parameters in some requests. While this constant is a bitmask, only the first **three** values (`casual`, `intermediate`, `veteran`) will ever be masked together; `elite` and `champion` should never be combined with other values.

```json
{
    "casual": 1,
    "intermediate": 2,
    "veteran": 4,
    "elite": 8,
    "champion": 16
}
```

#### battleFormat

These are used to identify what battle formats a leader supports, and will both be returned in some payloads and expected as parameters in some requests. This constant is a bitmask, as leaders can support multiple battle formats.

```json
{
    "singles": 1,
    "doubles": 2,
    "multi": 4,
    "special": 8
}
```

#### matchStatus

These are used to identify the current status of a match in the matches database table, and are only used **internally** to the API. Results are from the **challenger perspective** - `loss` refers to a challenger loss, and `win` a challenger win. `ash` and `gary` are special results for when a match is lost but a badge is awarded, or a match is won but a badge is **not** awarded (e.g. due to bad sportsmanship), respectively.

```json
{
    "inQueue": 0,
    "onHold": 1,
    "loss": 2,
    "win": 3,
    "ash": 4,
    "gary": 5
}
```

#### queueStatus

These are used to identify the current status of a leader's queue, and are only used **internally** to the API. While far from necessary, this constant helps keep the code more readable.

```json
{
    "closed": 0,
    "open": 1
}
```

#### pplEvent

These are used to identify what PAX event(s) a login is associated with, and are only used **internally** to the API. This constant is a bitmask, as users can and often do attend multiple events. It's mapped to the string values passed in the PPL-Event header expected in some requests.

```json
{
    "east": 1,
    "west": 2,
    "aus": 4,
    "online": 8
}
```

#### httpStatus

These are used as a mapping for the subset of HTTP status codes that can be returned, and are only used **internally** to the API. This mapping should be expanded if any additional status codes are ever used.

```json
{
    "ok": 200,
    "badRequest": 400,
    "unauthorized": 401,
    "notFound": 404,
    "serverError": 500
}
```

#### requestType

These are used to identify the type of request for permissioning when validating a session. Requests with type `challenger` will be rejected for leader logins, requests with type `leader` will be rejected for challenger logins, and requests with type `universal` will be allowed for both login types.

```json
{
    "challenger": 0,
    "leader": 1,
    "universal": 2
}
```

#### platformType

These are used to identify the platform a request is coming from. They're mapped from the `Platform` header in login and register requests, with `none` being used if the header is missing or an invalid value is provided.

```json
{
    "none": -1,
    "web": 0,
    "android": 1,
    "ios": 2
}
```

# Tests

This project currently contains six test suites in the /tests directory - three that run on the database module directly, and three that instantiate an instance of the API and run against that instead. The database test suites currently have full coverage of *all* functions exposed by the module, and the API test suites cover all but three paths (/register, /logview, and /logview/:daysago). Coverage should be sufficient to help find bugs in both the API and database modules before they make it to production.

The six suites are:

- [db-general.js](tests/db-general.js) - A database test suite covering general database functions, such as registration, login, and pulling down the list of challengers for a given event.
- [db-challenger.js](tests/db-challenger.js) - A database test suite covering challenger-oriented database functions, such as modifying the display name and joining leader queues.
- [db-leader.js](tests/db-leader.js) - A database test suite covering leader-oriented database functions, such as opening/closing the queue, adding challengers, and reporting match results.
- [api-general.js](tests/api-general.js) - An API test suite covering general, unauthenticated API paths. This suite covers mostly covers API paths that don't interact with the database.
- [api-challenger.js](tests/api-challenger.js) - An API test suite covering challenger-oriented API paths. This suite has roughly the same coverage as the db-challenger.js suite.g match results.
- [api-leader.js](tests/api-leader.js) - An API test suite covering leader-oriented API paths. This suite has roughly the same coverage as the db-leader.js suite.

As documented at the top of each test suite file, they're all intended to be run with certain environment variables which modify the behavior of the logging module and what database tables the tests should be performed on. The tests are intended to work off of a separate set of database tables, suffixed with `_test`, and pre-populated with the queries found in [baseline.sql](tests/baseline.sql). While each suite is designed to perform cleanup of any database changes it makes, the test tables *can* get out of sync with the baseline if certain tests or cleanup steps fail, so rerunning the baseline may be necessary in case of unexpected errors.
